### Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `svendasApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
# Run the application
$ mvnw spring-boot:run

# Build for deploy
$ mvnw clean package
```
